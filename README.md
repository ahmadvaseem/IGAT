**Internet Gaming Analysis and Trends **
Final year project of BS Computer Science. 
Developed in 2016. Based on Natual Language Processing. 

The aim of this project was to provide the automatic ratings of games on the basis of user comments and reviews. At the start, the data was being crawled
from different websites using focused crawling technique. After, the data was being scarped from the crawled pages using Html Agility Pack technologies. To
normalize the data, some preprocessing techniques i.e. Regular expression, stemming, stop words removal, etc. was used.
Sentiment analysis was performed to check the polarity of reviews on normalized information using Lexicon-based method and Na√Øve Bayes algorithm. C# ASP.Net was used for programming. 

This Repo includes all the data related to it. 
1. Proposal folder contains project's initial proposal.
2. FYP-I contains documentations (presentation, report include complete project detail along with use case diagram, SSD etc. ) and code of first 6 months of project.
3. FYP-II also contains documentations (presentation, report include complete project detail along with use case diagram, SSD etc. ) and code complete project.
